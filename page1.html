			<h2>Habitat Loss and Degradation</h2>
			<p>Deforestation is a direct cause of extinction and loss of biodiversity. An estimated 18 million acres of forest are lost each year, due in part to logging and other human practices, destroying the ecosystems on which many species depend. Tropical rainforests in particular, such as the Amazon, hold a high percentage of the world's known species, yet the regions themselves are in decline due to humans. What can we do?<br><br> The solutions to deforestation mostly lie in policy — companies and corporations can adopt best practices and refuse to use timber and paper suppliers that contribute to deforestation. In the same vein, conscious consumers can refuse to patronize companies that do, and put pressure on retailers that employ unsustainable manufacturing methods. Individuals can also participate in land preservation through charities and private corporations. Ultimately, however, international governments need to enact stronger, scientific forest protection laws.</p>

			<h2>Climate Change </h2>
				<p>
				Changes in climate throughout our planet's history have, of course, altered life on Earth in the long run — ecosystems have come and gone and species routinely go extinct. But rapid, manmade climate change speeds up the process, without affording ecosystems and species the time to adapt. For example, rising ocean temperatures and diminishing Arctic sea ice affects marine biodiversity and can shift vegetation zones, having global implications. Overall, climate is a major factor in the distribution of species across the globe; climate change forces them to adjust. But many are not able to cope, causing them to die out. What can we do?<br><br> Individuals can take various steps to fight climate change, such as reducing their carbon footprints, promoting education and contacting elected officials. International governments and cities can lead the charge, however, and the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris will hopefully be a turning point.</p>

				<h2>Excessive nutrient load and other forms of Pollution </h2>
				<p>From the burning of fossil fuels (releasing dangerous chemicals into the atmosphere and, in some cases, depleting ozone levels) to dumping 19 billion pounds of plastic into the ocean every year, pollution completely disrupts the Earth's ecosystems. While it may not necessarily cause extinction, pollutants do have the potential to influents species' habits.For example, acid rain, which is typically caused by the burning of fossil fuels, can acidify smaller bodies of water and soil, negatively affecting the species that live there by changing breeding and feeding habits.</p>

				<h2>Over-exploitation and Unsustainable use</h2>
				<p>Overhunting, overfishing and over-harvesting contribute greatly to the loss of biodiversity, killing off numerous species over the past several hundred years. Poaching and other forms of hunting for profit increase the risk of extinction; the extinction of an apex predator — or, a predator at the top of a food chain — can result in catastrophic consequences for ecosystems.What can we do?<br><br> Conservation and continued awareness surrounding overexploitation, especially poaching and overfishing, are key. Governments need to actively enforce rules against such practices, and individuals can be more conscious of what they eat and purchase. Other solutions, such as removing subsidies granted to large-scale fisheries, can help, too.
